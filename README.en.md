Startalk focuses on privatization based deployments. This caused Startalk's login looks more complicated. But it doesn't matter, the Startalk team is working to reduce the im system design threshold to a very low level, while also working to reduce the cost of the first use.

Usually, when we got a software, it will be divided into three steps:
